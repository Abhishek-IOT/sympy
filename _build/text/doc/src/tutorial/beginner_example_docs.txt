Basic Example
===========

Basic Example tells us about how to print a normal equation using Sympy.

Setting up Basic Example
====================

>>>from sympy import Symbol, pprint

Symbol for representing the Symbol(Expressions) and pprint function for printing the whole equation.


Differentiation Example
====================

Differentiation Example tells us how to use Sympy for differentiation.


Setting up Differentiation Example
==========================

>>>from sympy import pprint, Symbol

Symbol for representing the Symbol(Expressions) and pprint function for printing the whole equation.

Expansion Example
===================

Expansion Example tells us how to expand Expressions.


Setting up Expansion Example
=========================

>>>from sympy import pprint, Symbol

Symbol for representing the Symbol(Expressions) and pprint function for printing the whole equation.

Function Example
====================

Function Example tells us how to define function in Sympy.

Setting up Function Example
========================

>>>from sympy import pprint, Symbol, log, exp

Symbol for representing the Symbol(Expressions),pprint function for printing the whole equation, log for having the logarithm functions from use of Sympy and exp for having the use of e^x function.

Limited Example
=====================

Limited Example helps us in limit example.


Setting up Limited Example
========================

>>>from sympy import exp, log, Symbol, Rational, sin, limit, sqrt, oo

Symbol for representing the Symbol(Expressions),pprint function for printing the whole equation, log for having the logarithm functions from use of Sympy and exp for having the use of e^x function.Rational for having the representation of rational number (p/q).Sin is for having the sin of the variable.Limit computes the limit of ``e(z)`` at the point.Sqrt, oo are also the functions used in it.
